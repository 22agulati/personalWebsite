  <h1> Hobbies and Personal Interests </h1>
  <p> As a person, I'm always looking to learn. While technology, mathematics, and thoughts about the future are often taking up a majority
    of my mindspace, I do <strong>other</strong> things too! Here's a short list! </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Golf! I've been playing since I was about <em>2 years old!</em></li>
    <li>Listening to jazz and chill music</li>
    <li>Going to the gym (especially when there's no Covid)</li>
    <li>Blogging every now and then, <a href="https://arnavgul.wordpress.com/">here!</a></li>
    <li>Doing some new math / DL related thing; recently been playing around with TensorFlow!</li>
  </ul>
